// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// dispatcher.go routes inbound cluster messages to the per-channel BDLS
// Chain. The shape is deliberately identical to
// orderer/consensus/etcdraft/dispatcher.go:
//
//   * MessageReceiver is implemented by *Chain in chain.go.
//   * ReceiverGetter is implemented by *Consenter (via ReceiverByChain)
//     once Phase C7 lands.
//   * Dispatcher itself is a tiny fan-out that the cluster gRPC service
//     (RegisterClusterNodeServiceServer in consenter.go) points at.
//
// We intentionally keep the types separate from the etcdraft ones —
// orderer/common/server/main.go wires a per-consenter Dispatcher today,
// so sharing the type would force a cross-package dependency between
// etcdraft and bdls that buys nothing. Identical contract, distinct
// types.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// MessageReceiver is what per-channel BDLS chains expose to the Dispatcher
// for inbound routing. Both methods must be safe to call concurrently — the
// cluster service may fan out messages on multiple goroutines.
type MessageReceiver interface {
	// Consensus hands a ConsensusRequest (which carries a
	// BDLS-serialised SignedProto in its Payload) to the chain for
	// delivery to Consensus.ReceiveMessage.
	Consensus(req *orderer.ConsensusRequest, sender uint64) error

	// Submit hands a SubmitRequest (a client envelope) to the chain so
	// it can flow through the block-cutter and into a proposal.
	Submit(req *orderer.SubmitRequest, sender uint64) error
}

// ReceiverGetter is the Consenter-side hook the Dispatcher uses to find
// the per-channel chain. The Consenter's ReceiverByChain reads from the
// Registrar and returns nil if the channel is not (yet) known to this
// orderer — the Dispatcher surfaces that as "channel doesn't exist".
type ReceiverGetter interface {

// selector and a logger.
